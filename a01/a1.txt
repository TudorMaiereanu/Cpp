1.
Fix the program below such that it prints the correct result. Why is the result 0.000? Write your
answer and explanations within comments.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  float answer; /* The result of our calculation */
  answer = 1/8;
  printf("The value of 1/8 is %f\n", answer);
  return 0;
}

2.
Fix the program below such that it prints the correct value. Why does the program print “The
result is -1073745604”? (Values will vary). Write your answer and explanations within
comments.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int answer; /* The result of our calculation */
  answer = 3 + 12;
  printf("The answer is %d\n");
  return 0;
}

3.
You will get compiler errors, when you try to compile the example code given below.
Read the error messages that the compiler produces and fix the errors such that your source code
compiles successfully. Then fix the program to print the correct result. Explain within comments
the reason of the errors and describe your fixes.

include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  double result; /* The result of the division */
  int divisor = 22.0;
  result = 7 / divisor;
  printf("The result is %d\n", result);
  return 0;
}

4.
Write a program which does the following:
1. assigns 37 to an integer variable a and 14 to an integer variable b,
2. computes the sum of a and b and prints the result,
3. computes the product of a and b and prints the result,
4. computes the difference of a and b (in this order) and prints the result,
5. computes the division of a and b (in this order) and prints the result (the result should be a
double),
6. computes the remainder of the division of a and b (in this order) and prints the result,
7. prints the values of a and b.


*****************************************************************************************************


5.
Write a program which:
1. declares and initializes an integer variable a with 478, and prints the value of a over 9
places,
2. declares and initializes a float variable b with 􀀀29:7949954, and prints the value of b over
11 places and with a floating point precision of 3,
3. declares and initializes a char variable c with ’j’, and prints the character on the screen,
4. declares and initializes a double variable d with 946:3969843, and prints the value of d with
a floating point precision of 5.

6.
Write a program which declares and initializes a char variable called letter with ’P’ and prints
it on the screen as a character and as corresponding ASCII code separated by space.
