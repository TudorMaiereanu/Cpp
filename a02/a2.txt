1.
Write a program which does the following:
1. reads two floats from the keyboard,
2. prints the sum of the two floats on the screen,
3. prints the difference of the two floats (the order should be second ô€€€ first) on the screen,
4. prints the square of the first float on the screen,
5. reads two integers from the keyboard,
6. computes the sum and product of the two integers,
7. prints the sum, and the product of the integers on the screen,
8. reads two chars from the keyboard,
9. computes the sum and product of the two chars,
10. prints the sum and product of the chars as decimal values and as chars on the screen.

2.
Write a program which does the following:
1. reads an integer from the keyboard,
2. and prints the integer in decimal, octal and hexadecimal notation.

3.
Write a program where you can enter three values representing hours, minutes and seconds as
input from the keyboard. Your program should compute and output by printing on the screen
the total number of seconds corresponding to the total amount of time expressed by the three
previous values.

4.
Write a program that converts Centigrades (also known as Celsius) to Fahrenheit. You should be
able to enter a number from the keyboard representing the Celsius valus, then the result should
be computed and printed on the screen according to the following transformation formula:
F = 9*C/5 + 32

5.
Write a program which reads an integer variable val from the keyboard and prints the value on
the screen. Then declare and initialize a pointer ptr_val to val, print the address contained in
ptr_val on the screen, increment (i.e., add 1 to it) the value of val by using the pointer variable
and print the modified value and the address on the screen as well.

6.
Write a program which reads two float variables a and b from the keyboard. Then declare and
initialize three pointers ptr1, ptr2 and ptr3 such that ptr1 and ptr2 will both point to the
variable a and ptr3 will point to b. By using printf show that ptr1 and ptr2 contain the
same memory address and ptr3 contains a different address.
